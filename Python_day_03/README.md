# Day 02: URL Shortener

Welcome to **Day 02** of my 100 Days of Python Challenge! ðŸŽ‰ This project is a **URL Shortener** application built using Python. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for shortening URLs effortlessly using the `pyshorteners` library.

---

## Project Overview

The **URL Shortener** application allows users to:
1. Enter a long URL.
2. Shorten the URL with a single click.
3. View the shortened URL directly in the application.

The graphical interface is built using the `customtkinter` library, offering a modern and customizable look.

## Features

- **User-Friendly GUI**: Built with `customtkinter` for a clean, responsive, and dark-themed interface.
- **Efficient URL Shortening**: Utilizes the `pyshorteners` library to convert long URLs into shorter, shareable links.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages for invalid URLs or unexpected issues during the shortening process.
